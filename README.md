# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
<br> I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by not only testing if the code is accepting inputs correctly, but also if it is rejecting inputs correctly. The most reliable way to do this that I have learned thus far is through JUnit tests. It is still useful to rely on if-else to ultimately determine what a user is (not) allowed to do; however, JUnit tests can make sure that the if-else statement itself is functions. As for security, the code can be made secure by disallowing inputs/actions that could lead to security issues, and using JUnit tests to make sure that it is working as it should.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
<br> I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by turning the user's software requirements into a documented checklist that is referenced constantly through the coding and testing process. It helps at times to take each requirement, pinpoint what it should and should not do, and use those points to determine what needs to be tested.

# How do I approach designing software?
<br> I approach designing software by, oddly enough, writing things down a lot. I believe that anything that involves design also involves a lot of planning. It is no different when it comes to making software. Charts, lists, diagrams, etc. can be extremely helpful as visual aids and making sense of complex problems. Once I am done planning around the software requirements given to me, I use the coding program to make comments of what code needs to go where, and then write my codes beneath each comment as a way of keeping track of what needs to be done based on what I planned.
